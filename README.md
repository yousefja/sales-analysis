TODO: idk maybe time series forecast the top 10 products so I can make reccs like:
"here's what to stock up on, where to sell it, where to market it"

for each top 10 product:
- when it sells
- where it sells

deploy and create an API that makes sales predictions by region and by category depending on user filters

"based on sales projections for 2023, it would be a good idea to stock up in product x, which is projected to generate $49k in revenue based off of a, b, c". --> stuff like this. Market this region with this product, focus on these top selling products per region, etc. 

Segment the Forecast
     Break forecast by:
             Product line
             Region

Now you can:
            Flag underperforming products
            Tailor strategy per location

Example Insight:
“Forecast shows Northeast region lagging behind by 18% vs target. Recommend focusing ad spend there.”
